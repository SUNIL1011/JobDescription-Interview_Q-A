# JobDescription-Interview_Q-A
ðŸš€ Building an AI-Powered Hiring Assistant with Langraph! ðŸ¤–

Weâ€™re leveraging Langraph, an innovative framework for AI agents, to build a smart Job Description & Interview Assistant that:

âœ… Generates tailored job descriptions based on role, industry, and skills
âœ… Creates targeted interview questions to assess candidates effectively
âœ… Provides suggested answers to streamline the evaluation process

By combining LLMs with Langraphâ€™s intuitive workflow for AI agents

This code defines four functions for generating, improving, and refining a job description using an LLM:

generate_job_description(state) â€“ Creates an initial job description based on the given role.

check_skills(state) â€“ Checks if the role is related to Google or GCP; returns "Pass" if relevant, otherwise "Fail".

improve_job_description(state) â€“ Enhances the job description by adding Google, GCP, and related tools.

polish_job_description(state) â€“ Performs a final grammatical check and refines the job description.

final_job_interview(state) generates a set of interview questions and expected answers based on the finalized job description.
